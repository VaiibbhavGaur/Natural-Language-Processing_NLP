# SENTIMENT ANALYSIS ON IMDB DATASET

## Domain: Digital content and entertainment industry 

## Description

The objective of this project is to build a text classification model that analyses the customer's sentiments based on their reviews in the IMDB database. The
model uses a complex deep learning model to build an embedding layer followed by a classification algorithm to analyse the sentiment of the customers.

## Dataset
The Dataset of 50,000 movie reviews from IMDB, labelled by sentiment (positive/negative). Reviews have been preprocessed, and each review is
encoded as a sequence of word indexes (integers). For convenience, the words are indexed by their frequency in the dataset, meaning the for that has index 1 is the
most frequent word. Use the first 20 words from each review to speed up training, using a max vocabulary size of 10,000. As a convention, "0" does not stand for a
specific word, but instead is used to encode any unknown word.

# PROJECT OBJECTIVE: 
Build a sequential NLP classifier which can use input text parameters to determine the customer sentiments.
